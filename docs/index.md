This project's focus is on in-game Minecraft image conversion. Using self-made paired image data from Minecraft, we attempt to convert between weather conditions, like rainy and sunny, and between different times of day. Using a deep neural network with a U-net architecture, our machine learning model uses paired data to predict and generate images given each pair.

This project uses [pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/) in Pytorch as a reference to build the models.
