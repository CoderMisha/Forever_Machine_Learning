This project's focus is on in-game Minecraft image conversion. Using self-made paired image data from Minecraft, we attempt to convert between weather conditions, like rainy and sunny, and between different times of day. Using GAN's with Unets, our machine learning model uses paired data to predict and generate images given each pair.

Here are some examples of scenes we removed rain from:

Here are some examples of scenes we added rain to:

This project uses [pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/) in Pytorch as a reference to build the models.
